## How to Download and Install

1. **Download the Plugin**
   - Get the plugin from the GitHub Releases page or by downloading the source code.

2. **Install the Plugin**
   - Place the plugin folder into your project's `Plugins` directory. (Create a `Plugins` folder if it doesn't already exist.)

3. **Enable the Plugin**
   - The plugin should be enabled by default. However, double-check that it is enabled in the **Plugins** menu within Unreal Engine.

<p style="color:#4F7942;"> <b>[üí°Dependencies] This plugin depends on the <i>MeshPainting</i> plugin. The <i>MeshPainting</i> plugin is only used to paint the icons of the vertex light actors in the editor to match their light color or ambient color. It is NOT used for the actual vertex lighting.</b> </p>

## How to Use

1. **Set Up the Plugin**
   - In the Content Browser, navigate to the Vertex Lighting Plugin directory.
   - Drag and drop the `VertexLighting_Manager` into your level. <img src="images/guide_images/manager_in_folder.avif" alt="A guide image for the VertexLighting_Manager location in the folder" width="700">

2. **Configure Materials**
   - Locate the `VertexLights_MaterialFunction` in the Logic folder within the Vertex Lighting Plugin directory. <img src="images/guide_images/materialfunction_in_folder.avif" alt="A guide image for the materialfunction location in the folder" width="700">
   - Open the materials you want to use and multiply your base color/texture (Input A) with the `VertexLights_MaterialFunction` (Input B). <img src="images/guide_images/materialfunction.avif" alt="A guide image for the materialfunction in a material" width="600">
   - Connect the result of the multiplication to the `Base Color` and/or `Emissive Color` of your material.

3. **Add Lights**
   - Place a `VertexLighting_Light` or `VertexLighting_Light_Animated` actor into your level to add lights. <img src="images/guide_images/actors_in_folder.avif" alt="A guide image for the VertexLighting_Light and VertexLighting_Light_Animated location in the folder" width="700">

## Plugin Components

### **VertexLighting_Manager**
The `VertexLighting_Manager` is essential for vertex lighting functionality.   
<p style="color:#8A2BE2;"> <b>[üìëIMPORTANT] Ensure only <ins>one</ins> manager is present per level.</b> </p>

<p style="color:#D2042D;"> <b>[‚ÄºÔ∏èCAUTION] Only up to 256 vertex lights can be registered at the same time.</b> </p>
 
<img src="images/actor_icons/Light_Manager.avif" alt="The icon of the VertexLighting_Manager" width="200">

#### Default Settings:
- **Ambient Color**: Default environmental color.
  - *Default*: Hex sRGB - 7C7C7CFF | *Type*: Linear Color
- **SunNormalInfluence**: Controls how directional the vertex light sunlight should be, on a percentage basis. 0% makes the sunlight completely non-directional, while 100% makes it fully directional.
  - *Default*: 0% | *Type*: Float | *Range*: 0.0-100.0
- **ShowCombinedVertexLightInfo**: Enables debug information.
  - *Default*: True | *Type*: Boolean
 
#### Sun Direction:
The sun's direction is controlled by the rotation of the VertexLighting_Manager and is visually represented by a yellow arrow originating from the manager.

#### Tick Rate:
- **Light Update Tickrate**: Time interval between light updates. Set to `0.0` to disable updates.
  - *Default*: 0.1s | *Type*: Float | *Range*: 0.0-Infinite

#### In-Editor Events:
- **Draw All Preview Lights**: Displays all vertex lights in the editor.
- **Unregister All Preview Lights**: Stops displaying vertex lights in the editor.

### **VertexLighting_Light**
The `VertexLighting_Light` adds a static or dynamic vertex light to your scene. 
<p style="color:#0F52BA;"> <b>[üóíÔ∏èNOTE] <i>VertexLighting_Light</i> is not considered relevant for Level Bounds.</b> </p>   
   
<img src="images/actor_icons/Light.avif" alt="The icon of the VertexLighting_Light" width="200">

#### Default Settings:
- **Light Color**: Color of the light.
  - *Default*: Hex sRGB - FFFFFFFF | *Type*: Linear Color
<p style="color:#E1C16E;"> <b>[‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING] Overridden by color curves for <i>VertexLighting_Light_Animated</i>.</b> </p>
- **Brightness**: Light intensity.
  - *Default*: 10x | *Type*: Float | *Range*: 0.0-100.0
<p style="color:#E1C16E;"> <b>[‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING] Overridden by color curves for <i>VertexLighting_Light_Animated</i>.</b> </p>
- **Influence Radius**: Radius of the light's influence.
  - *Default*: 300cm | *Type*: Float | *Range*: 0.0-Infinite
- **Influence to Normal**: Controls how directional the vertex light should be, on a percentage basis. 0% makes the light completely non-directional, while 100% makes it fully directional.
  - *Default*: 0% | *Type*: Float | *Range*: 0.0-100.0
- **Render Distance**: Maximum render distance for the light.
  - *Default*: 10,000cm | *Type*: Float | *Range*: 0.0-10,000.0

### **VertexLighting_Light_Animated**
The `VertexLighting_Light_Animated` adds a static or dynamic vertex light with a color curve to your scene.
<p style="color:#0F52BA;"> <b>[üóíÔ∏èNOTE] The <i>VertexLighting_Light_Animated</i> inherits from <i>VertexLighting_Light</i>.</b> </p>

## Other Components
### **Color Curve**
`VertexLighting_Light_Animated` uses a color curve for its `Light Color` and `Brightness`

#### Color Channels:
- **R Channel**: Defines the red color
- **G Channel**: Defines the green color
- **B Channel**: Defines the blue color
- **A Channel**: Defines the brightness

## Troubleshooting

### **I can't see any vertex lights**
Ensure the following:
- A single `VertexLighting_Manager` is present in the level.
- You have placed `VertexLighting_Light` or `VertexLighting_Light_Animated` actors in your level instead of regular lights.
- The `VertexLights_MaterialFunction` is properly multiplied with your material's texture.
- The model has sufficient vertices within the light's influence range. Vertex lights only illuminate vertices, so ensure your model has enough for visible effects.
- You are not trying to light a [landscape](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-landscapes-in-unreal-engine).
